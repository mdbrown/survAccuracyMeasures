Description: This package provides a function to estimate the AUC, TPR(c),
    FPR(c), PPV(c), and NPV(c) for for a specific timepoint and marker cutoff
    value c using non-parametric and semi-parametric estimators. Standard errors 
    and confidence intervals are also computed. Either analytic or bootstrap 
    standard errors can be computed.
